# 29th Drive Quickstart

Design & Development quickstart with Foundation + Compass + Jekyll.

## Requirements

  * Ruby 1.9+
  * [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com): `gem install foundation`
  * [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)
  * [compass](http://compass-style.org/): `gem install compass`
  * [bower](http://bower.io): `npm install bower -g`
  * [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/): `gem install jekyll`

## Quickstart

  * [Download this starter compass project and unzip it](https://github.com/29thdrive/29th-drive-quickstart/archive/master.zip)
  * Run `bower install` to install the latest version of Foundation
  * __Important__ don't alter the files in the `bower_components` folder. These files will get updated when Foundation gets updated.
  
Then when you're working on your project, just run the following command:

```bash
compass watch
```

## Upgrading

If you'd like to upgrade to a newer version of Foundation down the road just run:

```bash
bower update
```
